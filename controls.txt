Inventory: Far left is the current crop selected (iterated by left and right keys.) Everything else is the amount of crop seeds you have. A crop with a + indicates 
that it is GMO. Planting crops will decrease the amount of that type of seed you have.

Shop: The shop is where you can trade gold for tool upgrades and seeds.

Mechanics: 
    Soil Quality: The quality of the soil is affected by a number of factors, including crop rotation and use of pesticides. Soil quality affects the quality and 
    thus sell price of crops planted.
    Crop Quality: Crop quality affects how much crops sell for. Crops planted using low soil quality, pesticides, etc will sell for less.
    Crop Risk: This is the chance for a crop to die each day. This can be decreased by good soil quality, watering, GMOs, pesticides, and planting crops in the 
    correct season.
    Day cycle: Interact with your house to enter the next day. There are 30 days in a season (except winter)

Objective: Make as much BANK as possible.
